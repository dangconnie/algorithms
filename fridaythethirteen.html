// ## Friday-the-Thirteens


// Given a year as a number (ex: 2016), print the number of Friday-the-thirteens in that year. Read about how to construct dates closely to get ideas on how to implement this: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date> #date #loop #medium #math


// --SUPER BONUS-- How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?





//In each year, loop through to find the number of Friday-the-thirteens in that year. Loop through 13 days of each month. If date = 5, that means it is a Friday.  Loop through 12 times each year (one time for each month). Pass year as a parameter into the function. 
//Questions asks for number of Friday the 13 in for a given year. There is only one Friday the 13th each year, so it should print out 1 if done correctly.


//i represents the number of times to loop through for each year
//add to counter when a Friday the 13th is discovered
//prints out 0 ---> code is not processing the date we're looking for??? What do I need to fix this?? Need to set a target date?



function fridaysThirteenth(year){
	var date = new Date();
	var counter = 0;

	for(var i=0; i<12; i++){
		//Set target date for loop to search for
		//i represents the month and 13th is the day in each month we're interested in. Year can be changed.
		var targetDate = date.setFullYear(year, i, 13);
		
		//getDay!!!! not getDate.
		if(date.getDay() === 5){
			counter++;
		}	
	} 
	console.log(counter)
